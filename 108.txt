plots different kinds of data to identify patterns 
in how the data is distributed

introduce to normal distribution
and its omni presence in the nature..(present everywhere)


-->student plots data from random dice throws
-->student identifies the bell curve pattern in the data
-->student plots other kinds of data and identifies the similar patterns (bell curve)


all these data could have a pattern(a pattern universally true
for almost all kinds of data)


teacher activity-1
roll the dice(there are two dice)
again and again 

record the different sums we get on a file

8
3
2
....
9

suppose we do it for 100 times, do you think there will be a pattern.
-------------------------------------------
so,let's write a python program which randomly generates two numbers between 1 to 6
for two different dice and adds them up

-->random module in python helps to generate random numbers

random.randint()--generate random numbers
